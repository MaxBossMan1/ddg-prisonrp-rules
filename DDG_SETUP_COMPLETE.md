## üöÄ Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Create Discord Application (If Not Done)
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Create a new application called "DDG PrisonRP Rules"
3. Go to OAuth2 section and copy:
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret**

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Edit your `backend/.env` file and add:
```env
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-client-id-here
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-actual-client-secret-here
```

### 3. Configure OAuth2 Redirect URLs
In your Discord application OAuth2 settings, add these redirect URLs:
```
http://localhost:3001/auth/discord/callback
https://your-domain.com/auth/discord/callback
```

### 4. Bot Permissions
Your bot needs these permissions in your Discord server:
- Read Messages
- View Channels
- Read Message History

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test role mappings
node scripts/manage-discord-roles.js list

# Test specific user permissions
node scripts/manage-discord-roles.js test 616691120407052291
node scripts/manage-discord-roles.js test 303675233359888384

# Start the server
npm run dev
```

### Test Login
1. Start your server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000/staff/staff-dashboard-2025/dashboard
3. Click "Login with Discord"
4. You should be redirected to Discord OAuth
5. After authorization, you'll be logged in with appropriate permissions

## üîß Permission System

### How It Works
1. **Hardcoded Owners**: Always get owner permissions regardless of Discord roles
2. **Role-Based**: Users get permissions based on their Discord server roles
3. **Real-Time**: Permissions update when Discord roles change
4. **Logging**: All authentication events are logged for security

### Permission Levels
- **Owner**: Full access to everything (hardcoded users)
- **Admin**: Can manage rules, users, and announcements  
- **Moderator**: Can edit rules and manage content
- **Editor**: Can edit rules and basic content

## üõ†Ô∏è Management Commands

```bash
# List all role mappings
node scripts/manage-discord-roles.js list

# Add a new role mapping
node scripts/manage-discord-roles.js add ROLE_ID ROLE_NAME PERMISSION_LEVEL

# Remove a role mapping  
node scripts/manage-discord-roles.js remove ROLE_ID

# Test user permissions
node scripts/manage-discord-roles.js test DISCORD_USER_ID

# Sync all users' roles
node scripts/manage-discord-roles.js sync-all
```

## üö® Important Security Notes

1. **Never share your bot token** - It's already configured in your .env
2. **Keep your client secret secure** - Don't commit it to git
3. **Use HTTPS in production** - Update redirect URLs when deploying
4. **Monitor auth logs** - Check database for suspicious activity

## üéØ Ready to Go!

Your system is now configured for Discord authentication! Just add your Discord app credentials to the .env file and you're ready to test.
